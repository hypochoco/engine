# TODO

Gaps between [goals](goals.md) and [current state](architecture.md), roughly prioritized.
Not commitments — a backlog to reason about.

## Foundational (blocks most other work)

- [~] **ECS core.** DECIDED archetype (2026-07-03); phase 1 landed: `engine::ecs` with
      `Entity` (generational `core::Handle`), `World`, archetype/table storage, and
      `query<Ts...>().each/.chunks`. Ships `engine::Transform` (in `core`). Verified by
      `tst/ecs_test`. **Resources + ordered scheduler DONE** (2026-07-03): `World::setResource/
      getResource` + `Schedule` (ordered `void(World&)` systems); `tst/scheduler_test`
      (deterministic gravity→integrate). Next: command buffer + add/remove-component, and
      parallel worlds. **Render-extraction DONE** (2026-07-03):
      `engine::scene` bridge (`RenderMesh`/`RenderMaterial` components + `scene::extract` →
      `RenderView`); `tst/scene_offscreen` + ECS-driven `tst/visual_window`. Plan:
      [2026-07-03-ecs-plan.md](../investigations/2026-07-03-ecs-plan.md).
- [ ] **Driver test harness (not a `main`).** The engine is a library with no application
      entry point; consuming apps own the loop. Instead build a suite of driver tests under
      `tst/` that construct subsystems and drive the update→render loop to validate them.
- [ ] **Break the window/swapchain coupling.** Introduce a headless device/context path so
      ML training and offline rendering can run without GLFW. Today `Graphics` assumes a
      window + swapchain end to end.

## Driving milestone: "a ball rolling down a plane"

See goals.md. Long-term vertical slice: sphere rolling down an inclined plane, plus the
capability targets that make it exercise our goals — headless + deferred rendering, parallel
sims for training, and massive scale (~100k spheres). This is the yardstick for whether core
is "good enough" and defines what the graphics refactor pass must support.

## Core (in progress — build standalone first)

Build `engine::core` to a good state before touching graphics. See
[2026-07-02-core-module-plan.md](../investigations/2026-07-02-core-module-plan.md).

- [ ] **geometry/**: `Vertex` (position, **normal**, uv, color), `MeshData`, `Mesh`,
      minimal `Material`, `ModelData`. + `core.h` umbrella.
- [ ] **geometry/primitives**: `makeQuad` / `makePlane` / `makeSphere` generators (feed the
      milestone + give `tst` real geometry without asset files).
- [ ] **image/**: `Image` + `ImageFormat`.
- [ ] **io/**: `readFile`, `loadObj` → `ModelData`, `loadImage` → `Image`. NOTE: centralize
      the stb/tinyobj implementation macros in exactly one TU (they currently live in
      graphics) to avoid duplicate symbols when both link — do this when graphics is
      refactored, or keep loaders' impls out of any target that also links graphics.
- [ ] **tst driver**: build meshes via primitives, assert counts. Link `engine::core` only.

Scaling / ownership (from [2026-07-02-geometry-scaling.md](../investigations/2026-07-02-geometry-scaling.md)):
- [ ] Treat `MeshData`/`ModelData` as **loader output only** — not the runtime store; never
      hold ~100k of them (scattered heap allocs + deep-copy value semantics don't scale).
- [ ] **Central geometry store (pooled vertex/index arenas) + generational `MeshHandle`s** as
      the scalable runtime store; entities reference geometry by handle, not pointer. This is
      the trigger to un-defer `memory/` (`Handle`/`slot_map`) — build the minimal version
      inside this store first, promote to core only if a 2nd consumer needs it.
- [ ] Drive the milestone's 100k spheres via **instancing** (one geometry + 100k transforms),
      with per-frame data in **flat SoA** render/instance arrays (ties to the DrawJob rework).
- [ ] Derive **bounds / position-only data** for physics/culling instead of walking
      interleaved `Vertex` arrays on CPU hot paths.
- [ ] Later/at-scale: **vertex compression** (compact GPU layout, keep core::Vertex as the
      authoring format) and **distinct-geometry streaming/LOD**; decide CPU-retention policy
      (don't keep CPU vertex copies after upload except for collision/raycast).

## Graphics refactor pass (LATER — after core is solid)

**Do NOT refactor graphics incrementally.** Once core is in a good state, refactor the entire
graphics package in one dedicated pass, behind the RHI. Full analysis:
[2026-07-01-graphics-refactor.md](../investigations/2026-07-01-graphics-refactor.md) and
[2026-07-02-metal-backend.md](../investigations/2026-07-02-metal-backend.md).
**Key framing: "add Metal" and "do the refactor" are the same effort** — both require
extracting a backend-agnostic interface (RHI) and putting Vulkan behind it.

- [x] **0. Decide: build-your-own RHI vs. adopt one.** DECIDED (2026-07-02): **build our
      own** — no third-party RHI. Both Vulkan and Metal backends are hand-written.
- [ ] **1. Adopt `engine::core` in graphics**: replace graphics' `Vertex`/`Mesh`/`Material`
      and its OBJ/image loading with core's; delete the now-duplicated code. Each backend
      maps `core::Vertex` to its own vertex format. (Core itself is built in the Core section
      above, before this pass.)
- [x] **2. Define the RHI interface** — DONE (headers, 2026-07-02). Landed under
      `include/engine/graphics/rhi/` (types, resources, pipeline, command_list, device +
      `rhi.h` umbrella) and `include/engine/graphics/render/` (render_view, geometry_store,
      renderer). Interface-only, no backend, compiles clean (`-Wall -Wextra`). Decisions:
      handle-based, compile-time backend, **bindless**, Vulkan dynamic rendering; **Metal
      first**; **Slang** shaders. Design + sequencing:
      [2026-07-02-rhi-interface-plan.md](../investigations/2026-07-02-rhi-interface-plan.md)
      (§13 supersedes the ordering below).
- [ ] **3. Reorganize existing Vulkan code** into `src/graphics/vulkan/` behind the RHI;
      delete the 3 duplicated pipeline builders; fold `graphics_custom.cpp` offscreen helpers
      into the pipeline/pass API. (Design Vulkan side around dynamic rendering to line up
      with Metal.)
- [~] **4. Multi-backend CMake** — mostly DONE (2026-07-02): **Foundation** linked, `external/
      metal-cpp` on the include path, one TU (`metal/metal_backend.cpp`) defines the impl
      macros, **per-backend source selection** (`metal/` vs `vulkan/` + shared `common/`),
      `test`→`tst`, `ENGINE_RHI_METAL/VULKAN` defines. Remaining: enable `OBJCXX` when the
      `.mm` window shim lands (headless Metal is pure C++, so not needed yet).
- [x] **5. Shader toolchain** — DONE (2026-07-03): **Slang** chosen and wired.
      `scripts/get_slang.sh` fetches `slangc` into gitignored `external/slang/`;
      `shaders/CMakeLists.txt` compiles `.slang` → `.metallib` (Apple) / `.spv` (else) and
      exposes `ENGINE_SHADER_DIR`. `rhi::ShaderModule`/`createShader` loads the backend blob.
      First shader: `shaders/triangle.slang`.
- [~] **6. Implement the Metal backend** incrementally — offscreen + **windowed** working
      (2026-07-03): `tst/mesh_offscreen` (headless, pixel-verified) and `tst/visual_window`
      (opens a GLFW window, renders a lit `core` sphere via CAMetalLayer swapchain + present).
      Implemented: headless & windowed Device, handle pools, metallib libs, pipeline + vertex
      descriptor + depth-stencil, render-encoder lifecycle, indexed draw, depth, readback,
      CAMetalLayer/drawable present (`metal_window.mm` shim via `glfwGetCocoaWindow`;
      `OBJC`+`OBJCXX` enabled). Next: **uniforms + camera (MVP)** so geometry isn't in clip
      space, then **instance storage + bindless** (ECS/instancing path). TODO: window resize
      (swapchain + depth recreate; currently fixed-size), staging for Private resources,
      fence-gated deletion, per-frame-in-flight sync.
- [ ] **7. Split `Swapchain` + `Renderer`; headless path** for both backends (ML/offline).
- [~] **8. Rework the render-list / instance path** — instancing + **per-instance materials**
      done (2026-07-03): `RenderView { view/proj, target, RenderItem[], InstanceData[],
      MaterialGPU[] }` consumed by `render::Renderer`; per-instance SoA data + a materials
      storage buffer (each instance's `materialIndex` → `baseColorFactor`); one instanced
      `drawIndexed` per RenderItem. Verified: `mesh_offscreen` (3 differently-colored instanced
      spheres, red center), `visual_window` (NxN color-gradient grid, `ENGINE_GRID=N`).
      Remaining: **bindless texture table** (`baseColorTexture` + `registerBindlessTexture` are
      stubs — defer until textured surfaces are needed; Metal argument-buffer + residency work);
      ECS-driven extraction/culling/sorting once ECS exists; the indirect/GPU-driven path.

Known bugs/smells to fix along the way (details in the refactor investigation):
- [ ] `loadQuad` mis-computes `vertexCount`/`indexCount` (cumulative, not per-mesh counts).
- [ ] `copyInstanceToBuffer` always copies `MAX_ENTITIES`; dirty-range copy is stubbed out.
- [ ] `renderFinishedSemaphores` indexed per-frame not per-image (masked by frames=1).
- [ ] macOS `vkQueueWaitIdle` after every present + `MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT = 1` → no
      pipelining. Revisit with multiple frames in flight.
- [ ] "paint"/"stamp" naming leftovers from the source app.
- [ ] `GlobalUBO` lights (`// todo: lights`).
- [ ] Deferred deletion queue (readme.md sketch), once resources outlive a frame.

## Compute / ML

- [ ] **Compute pipeline + compute-queue support.** Needed for ML workloads and some
      rendering; only graphics pipelines exist today.
- [ ] **Parallel environment stepping / batching** for training throughput.
- [ ] **Determinism review** for reproducible training.

## Physics

Plan (all 8 decisions settled): [2026-07-03-physics-plan.md](../investigations/2026-07-03-physics-plan.md).
Multi-backend behind a **runtime-virtual** `PhysicsWorld`; shared collision/broadphase
substrate; realtime (impulse) + implicit/**differentiable** backends; rotational dynamics.

- [~] **Simulation core.** **Phase 0 + Phase 1 DONE** (2026-07-03): ECS-free `engine::physics`
      core (shapes, exact contacts, rigid-body state + inertia, pure integration kernels incl.
      SO(3) exp/log) + the runtime-virtual **`PhysicsWorld` interface** + a **realtime
      sequential-impulse backend** (restitution/friction/Baumgarte, substeps, rotation) + the
      **`engine::physics_ecs` bridge** (RigidBody + step/sync systems). **Milestone met**:
      `tst/physics_milestone` (headless — ball rolls without slipping down a 30° incline,
      analytic match) + `tst/physics_window` (windowed, full stack). Next: Phase 2 GJK/EPA +
      box/convex + SAP/BVH broadphase (100k); Phase 3 implicit/differentiable backend +
      parallel worlds.
- [x] **How physics state maps onto ECS components.** DECIDED (2026-07-03): backend owns
      packed state; ECS holds `RigidBody{BodyHandle}` (no pose) + keeps `Transform` separate
      (no replacement/inheritance); a `physics_ecs` bridge syncs world poses → Transform. ML
      path omits Transform entirely. (physics-plan Q2/Q3)

## Infra / quality

- [ ] Multithreaded task system (readme.md sketches work-stealing + task dependency graph).
- [ ] Test setup (no framework wired up yet).

## Open design questions (revisit "at some point")

Parked decisions we agreed to defer. Answer before the work they gate.

- [x] **ECS approach: archetype vs sparse-set.** DECIDED (2026-07-03): **archetype** — best
      multi-component iteration/cache, maps onto batched instancing + the 100k case; structural
      changes (rare in a sim) are its weak spot but acceptable. (ecs-plan §3)
- [ ] **ML training model: many envs in-process vs separate processes.** Drives the
      headless context design and how far determinism must reach.
- [ ] **Offline renderer basis:** is `graphics_custom.cpp`'s offscreen helper set intended
      to grow into the offline/high-quality renderer?
- [x] **Build-your-own RHI vs. adopt.** DECIDED (2026-07-02): build our own; no third-party
      RHI. (metal-backend §3)
- [x] **Shader language/toolchain**: DECIDED (2026-07-03) — **Slang** (one source → SPIR-V +
      metallib), wired via `slangc`. (metal-backend §5)
- [ ] **RHI dispatch**: runtime-virtual (simpler) vs. compile-time (zero overhead).
- [ ] **Metal API level**: classic `MTL` (widest support) vs. `MTL4` (newer, Vulkan-like;
      present in vendored metal-cpp).
- [ ] **Future D3D12 / Windows?** If likely, argues harder for adopting an RHI now.
