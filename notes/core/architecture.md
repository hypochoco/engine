# Architecture (as-is)

Snapshot of the current structure. This describes what exists today, not the target.
Last synced with code: 2026-07-03.

## Build & layout

- C++23, CMake `>= 3.25`, `compile_commands.json` exported.
- **Default build type = RelWithDebInfo** (optimized) when none is given — a plain
  `cmake -S . -B build` would otherwise be unoptimized (no `-O`/`NDEBUG`), which runs physics
  ~20-50× slower and makes interactive visuals stutter/slow-mo. Override with
  `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`. (Multi-config generators pick per-build.)
- Split `include/` (public headers) vs `src/` (implementation).
- Per-module build files live under a single top-level **`modules/`** dir (`modules/<name>/
  CMakeLists.txt`, aggregated by `modules/CMakeLists.txt`), separate from their source under
  `src/` and headers under `include/`. `tst/` (which holds actual driver sources) stays at the
  root. CMake uses `GLOB_RECURSE` (incl. `.mm`) + `source_group`.
- **Backend is platform-selected**: `if(APPLE)` → Metal + QuartzCore frameworks;
  `else()` → `find_package(Vulkan)`.

## Graphics module (`engine::graphics`)

**Current path (RHI + Metal)** — see the "Build reality (2026-07-03)" callout above for the
authoritative description. In short: a hand-written **RHI** (`include/engine/graphics/rhi/`) with
a working **Metal backend** (`src/graphics/metal/`), plus a **render layer**
(`include/engine/graphics/render/`) — `GeometryStore` (uploads `core::MeshData`), `RenderView`
(camera + `RenderItem[]` + per-instance `InstanceData[]` + `MaterialGPU[]`), and `Renderer`
(instanced `drawIndexed`, per-instance materials, depth, offscreen + windowed present). Slang
shaders (`shaders/*.slang` → `.metallib`). This is what the tests and the milestone exercise.

### Legacy Vulkan code (parked under `src/graphics/vulkan/`, NOT the current path)

The original monolithic `Graphics` class (~460 lines in `graphics.h`, derived from the
vulkan-tutorial.com flow) is parked pending the Vulkan-behind-RHI port (todo.md "Graphics
refactor pass" item 3). It does **not** build on Apple and is not linked into the Metal path.
Kept for reference / to port from:

- **`graphics.cpp`** (~48 KB) — instance/device selection, logical device, textures
  (staging, mipmaps, image views, sampler), buffers, single-time command helpers,
  memory-type lookup, debug messenger, validation layers, macOS portability handling.
- **`graphics_swapchain.cpp`** (~29 KB) — swapchain create/recreate/cleanup, render pass,
  descriptor set layout/pool/sets, the main graphics pipeline, command buffer recording,
  and the per-frame acquire → record → submit → present loop.
- **`graphics_custom.cpp`** (~27 KB) — reusable helpers for *custom/offscreen* targets:
  `createRenderPass`, `createFramebuffer`, `createDescriptorSet(s)`, `createPipeline`
  (incl. push-constant overload), and granular `record*` command helpers.
- **`graphics_model.cpp`** (~8 KB) — `loadQuad`, `loadObj` (via tinyobjloader).
- **`graphics_instance.cpp`** (~2 KB) — `updateGlobalUBO`, `addDrawJob`, `copyInstanceToBuffer`.

Legacy data structures (in the old `graphics.h`): `Vertex`/`Mesh`/`Material`/`GlobalUBO`/
`InstanceSSBO`/`DrawJob` + Vulkan helpers. Its shared-buffer + `DrawJob` + per-frame instance
SSBO layout was the data-oriented seed the current `render::` layer grew from. Hardcoded caps
still in that code: `MAX_FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT = 1`, `NUM_TEXTURES = 16`, `MAX_ENTITIES = 16`,
`WIDTH/HEIGHT 800x600`. Known smells to fix during the port live in todo.md.

## Physics module (`engine::physics`, Phase 0–2 + collision polish, 2026-07-03)

ECS-free, backend-agnostic core (depends on `engine::core` only — no ecs, no graphics).
Design + phasing + differentiable-backend design-ahead: investigations/2026-07-03-physics-plan.md.
- **Shapes**: `Sphere`, `Plane` (half-space), `Box` (oriented), `ConvexHull` (vertex set),
  `Capsule` (segment + radius). GJK `support()` seam via `SupportShape`.
- **Collision**: exact primitive fast paths (`sphereVsSphere`, `sphereVsPlane`, analytic
  `sphereVsBox`, `boxVsPlane`/`pointsVsPlane`/`capsuleVsPlane` multi-contact resting, analytic
  `capsuleVsSphere`/`capsuleVsCapsule`), **GJK closest-distance** (`gjk_distance`, witness
  points) for accurate **capsule-vs-box/hull** (segment↔convex, up to 2 contacts), **GJK + EPA**
  for the separating normal, and **face-clip manifolds** for polytope pairs — `box_box` and
  generic `convex_manifold` (box-hull, hull-hull) — giving up to 4 points so boxes/hulls
  **stack** stably. Verified: `tst/physics/unit/collision.cpp` (box/hull depth+normal exact,
  GJK-distance, capsule-convex), `tst/physics/unit/{sphere_box,manifolds,segments}.cpp`
  (sphere-box face/edge/corner/inside, plane manifold counts, capsule segment cases), and
  `tst/physics/integration/rigidbody.cpp` (box/hull/capsule rest flat |ω|≈0; sphere-on-box;
  box & hull **stacks** upright; capsule-on-box).
- **Solver robustness**: Baumgarte correction velocity is **clamped** (prevents fast/low-inertia
  bodies diverging). **CCD** (`WorldDef::continuousDetection`, default on): swept broadphase
  AABBs + **speculative contacts** (contacts within the substep's closing distance, solved so a
  body stops at the surface rather than tunnelling). The speculative branch targets the
  **restitution rebound velocity** when a pair is bouncing (so CCD doesn't brake the approach
  away and silently cancel restitution). Verified: a 120 m/s sphere stops on a small box
  (y=0.60) instead of passing through (y=−27), and an e=1 drop rebounds fully with CCD on
  (`tst/physics/integration/{rigidbody,dynamics}.cpp`).
- **Dynamics**: `RigidBodyState`, `PhysicsMaterial` (restitution, friction, compliance),
  inertia helpers; pure integration kernels — semi-implicit `integrateLinear`, SO(3) exp/log
  orientation (`so3ExpMap`/`integrateOrientation`), differentiable-ready (plan §14).
- **`PhysicsWorld` interface** (Phase 1): runtime-virtual coarse boundary (`createBody`/`step`/
  bulk `poses()`/`linearVelocities()`/`angularVelocities()`/`contacts()`), `BodyDef`/`WorldDef`,
  `createPhysicsWorld(Backend, ...)` factory. Multiple backends can coexist (plan §1).
- **Realtime backend** (`backends/realtime`, private to its TU): semi-implicit Euler +
  **sequential-impulse (PGS)** contact solver (restitution, Coulomb friction, Baumgarte),
  substeps × velocity iterations. Friction at the contact point applies torque ⇒ **true
  rolling**.
- **Joints** (Milestone 2, Phase B1, 2026-07-03): maximal-coordinate **bilateral constraints**
  solved in the same velocity loop as contacts, but **persistent** (created once via
  `createJoint(JointDef)`; kept in an index-stable `joints_` store) and **warm-started across
  steps**. Types: **Ball** (point-to-point, 3×3 K-matrix), **Revolute/hinge** (point + 2 angular
  axes), **Fixed/weld** (point + 3-axis orientation lock to a creation-time reference). Solved
  **serially in creation order** (deterministic) — angular part before the point part each
  iteration for stable coupling — **per-world, allocation-free, no statics** (VecEnv-safe).
  Baumgarte `kJointBaumgarte=0.2`, no slop. Stiff mass/inertia ratios (e.g. a point-mass on a
  long lever) need more iterations/substeps, as with contacts.
  **Limits (B2)**: Revolute min/max angle enforced as a one-sided constraint about the axis.
  **Actuators (B3)**: per Revolute joint, mode ∈ {`Torque`, `PDTarget(kp,kd,target,targetVel)`}
  + `maxTorque` clamp, applied about the hinge axis as an external angular impulse in the
  velocity-integration phase (RL torque semantics). **State read-path**: `JointState{q,qd}`
  (hinge angle/rate about the axis) via `jointState(h)` + bulk `jointStates()` span; **bulk
  action write** via `setJointTargets/Torques(span)` (batched observation/action for VecEnv).
  Tests: `tst/physics/unit/joints.cpp` (ball anchors coincide; hinge confines to axis + preserves
  on-axis spin; fixed holds a cantilever; hinge limit settles at the clamp; PD holds a target
  angle vs gravity; torque drives the joint; bulk write/read roundtrip).
  **Ball actuation (B4)**: 3-DOF spherical PD (`actuator.ballTarget`) or direct `ballTorque`,
  clamped to `maxTorque`, applied as a 3-DOF angular impulse. Multi-DOF ball `q/qd` for RL obs is
  derivable from the exposed body poses/`angularVelocities` (flat per-joint SoA is a follow-up).
- **Self-collision filtering (B4)**: `BodyDef::collisionCategory`/`collisionMask` (default = collide
  with all); a pair collides iff `(A.cat & B.mask) && (B.cat & A.mask)`. Articulation limbs share a
  category and mask it out so they don't fight their joints (still collide with the ground).
- **Optional velocity damping (B4)**: `WorldDef::linear/angularDamping` (default 0; drag applied to
  dynamic bodies each substep) so undamped joint DOFs (a ragdoll's free-spinning limb) settle.
- **Articulation (B4, `dynamics/articulation.h`)**: plain-data `ArticulationDef` (bodies +
  `JointSpec`s referencing bodies by index) → `buildArticulation(world)` → handles;
  `makeHumanoid()` preset = **~1.70 m** figure, **14 bodies** (pelvis, torso, shoulders, head,
  L/R upper+lower arms, L/R thigh+shin, L/R feet) + **13 joints** (ball waist/hips/shoulders,
  fixed chest/neck, hinge elbows/knees/ankles with limits). **Segments do not overlap** — each
  joint sits in the *gap* between two bodies (connected only by the constraint, an "invisible
  skeleton"). **Feet are the last two bodies** by contract so a renderer can draw them as boxes
  and the rest as stretched spheres (ellipsoids). Headless `tst/physics/integration/ragdoll.cpp`
  (passive ragdoll collapses + settles on the plane).
- **Humanoid behaviours (B5)**: `tst/physics/integration/humanoid_control.cpp` — `pd_stand_holds_pose`
  (pinned pelvis; PD servos drive bent knees against gravity + hold neutral elbows) and
  `articulation_determinism` (serial vs pooled/parallel bit-identical with joints+actuators).
  Visual: `tst/physics/visual/humanoid.cpp` — a gallery of three figures (free ragdoll +
  pelvis-pinned PD neutral hold + PD knee-bend hold; ankle gains scaled down to the light feet so
  they don't buzz). Limbs render as **capsules** matching their colliders, bulky bodies as
  stretched spheres, feet as boxes; fly camera. `core::geometry` gained `makeBox(halfExtents)` and
  `makeCapsule(radius, halfHeight)` (the box + capsule primitives the engine previously lacked).
- **Broadphase** (Phase 2, `broadphase/`, selectable via `WorldDef::broadphase`):
  - **Sweep-and-prune** (single-axis): great for small/clustered scenes; ~O(n^5/3) for a 3-D
    cube of bodies (active list holds a whole slab).
  - **Uniform spatial-hash grid** (default): flat "index sort" (sorted `(cellHash,body)`
    entries + `thread_local` scratch, no per-step allocation), cell = largest AABB. **Linear
    scaling**. The entry sort uses `core::parallelSort` when the world has a pool (sparse 65k
    free-fall: ~1.3× from parallel sort + integration).
  Both verified against brute force in `tst/physics/unit/kernels.cpp`. Planes (infinite) are tested against
  finite bodies directly. Measured (Release, free-fall, `tst/physics/benchmark/step.cpp`): at **65,536**
  bodies grid = **19.9 ms/step** vs SAP 192 ms vs the O(n²) baseline's ~14 s extrapolation
  (~**700×**); grid throughput ~3.3–5.4 M body-steps/s across 256→65k (flat), SAP falls
  15.6M→0.34M. Crossover ~1–2k. 100k ≈ 30 ms/step single-threaded. See
  investigations/2026-07-03-physics-baseline.md.

### Threading (`engine::core::ThreadPool`)
A minimal fixed-size worker pool with a blocking `parallelFor` (dynamic work-stealing; the
caller thread participates). Verified by `tst/core/unit/thread_pool.cpp` (every index visited once, no
races). `core` links `Threads::Threads`. Two physics consumers:
- **Parallel worlds** (ML many-envs / "parallel simulations"): independent `PhysicsWorld`s
  stepped concurrently — **7.7× on 12 workers** (4.7M → 36.8M body-steps/s).
- **Intra-world** (optional `WorldDef::threadPool`): the step parallelizes integration,
  narrowphase (per-pair, lock-free), and the **contact solver via graph coloring** (same-color
  contacts share no dynamic body → solved in parallel; colors sequential). Both serial and
  pooled paths use the color order, so results are **bit-identical** (determinism verified in
  `tst/physics/integration/rigidbody.cpp`, max err 0.0). Dense 32k-body pile: **1.66×** (Amdahl-limited by the still
  serial grid sort + per-color barriers — a parallel sort is the next lever). Static bodies are
  never written, so shared colliders (the plane) are race-free.
- `physics::Real` localizes the scalar for a future double/dual-number switch.

### physics_ecs bridge (`engine::physics_ecs`)
Depends on `engine::physics` + `engine::ecs` (separate from `scene`, which pulls graphics).
`RigidBody{ BodyHandle }` component (no pose — Q2); `PhysicsWorldRef`/`FixedStep` resources;
`stepSystem` + `syncSystem` (bulk world poses → `Transform`) added to an `ecs::Schedule`.
**Articulation bridge (B4)**: `Joint{ JointHandle }` + `JointCommand{ target, torque }`
components; `actuatorFlushSystem` writes each joint's command to the world (run before
`stepSystem`); `spawnArticulation(ecsWorld, physicsWorld, ArticulationDef)` builds the bodies +
joints and mirrors them into the ECS (an entity per body with `RigidBody`+`Transform`, per joint
with `Joint`+`JointCommand`). Verified: `tst/physics/integration/articulation_ecs.cpp` (humanoid
built in ECS; actuator→step→sync schedule; Transforms track poses exactly, ragdoll settles).

### physics_env — RL env layer (`engine::physics_env`, Phase D, 2026-07-04)
Headless, **ECS-free** RL interface (deps `engine::physics` + `engine::core` only). The mechanism
for training; **no reward/termination/task** (those are downstream — the env exposes raw state).
- **`Environment`** (`physics_env/environment.h`): a thin layer over one `PhysicsWorld` + an
  `Articulation` (+ ground plane). `reset(seed)` (in-place: `setBodyState` to authored pose +
  `clearState` + zero actions + optional randomization hook + `refreshState`), `setAction(span)`
  (Torque control — revolute 1 DOF, ball 3 DOF, fixed 0; `actDim=21` for the humanoid), `step()`
  (one control step = `substeps` physics substeps). **Raw-state accessors**: `jointStates()` (q/qd),
  `rootPose()`, root lin/ang velocity, per-body `bodyContactFlags()`. Downstream composes its obs
  from these; an **optional default flat packer** (`defaultObsDim()=53`: root pose 7 + twist 6 +
  q,qd + contacts) is a convenience for tests/examples, not the contract.
- **`VecEnv`** (`physics_env/vec_env.h`): N independent `Environment`s (each a single-threaded
  `PhysicsWorld`) stepped across a `core::ThreadPool` via `parallelFor` (**no nesting** — the ML
  throughput lever is parallel *worlds*). Contiguous SoA batches: `actions()[N*actDim]` (caller
  writes), `observations()[N*obsDim]` (default packer). `reset(seed)` (per-env `seed+i`),
  `resetMasked(mask)`, `step()`.
- **In-place reset support** added to `PhysicsWorld`: `setBodyState`, `clearState`, `refreshState`,
  `setJointBallTorque`.
- **D0 solver perf**: per-body world inverse inertia is now cached once per substep
  (`computeWorldInvInertia`) and read by the contact/joint/actuator/limit solves, instead of
  recomputing `R·I⁻¹·Rᵀ` per body per constraint per iteration — bit-identical (determinism tests
  still 0), win scales with contacts×iterations.
- Tests: `tst/physics_env/unit/environment.cpp` (dims 21/53, bounded random rollout, deterministic
  0.0), `tst/physics_env/integration/vec_env.cpp` (parallel==serial, bit-identical), benchmark
  `tst/physics_env/benchmark/vec_env.cpp` (N=1→1024; ~8.7k→68.7k env-steps/s on 13 workers).

### Milestone status — "ball rolling down a plane" ✅ (physics + sim)
- `tst/physics/integration/milestone.cpp` (headless): sphere on a 30° incline via the ECS bridge
  + scheduler. Verified it descends, travels down-slope, and **rolls without slipping** —
  |ω|·r ≈ down-slope speed, matching `a = g·sinθ/(1+2/5)` (measured 7.02 m in 2 s vs 7.01 analytic).
- `tst/physics/visual/rolling.cpp` (windowed, user-run, in the `visuals` runner): N spheres
  rolling down a tilted plane, physics → sync → `scene::extract` → Metal Renderer. Ties every
  subsystem together.
- **Test coverage** (`tst/physics/{unit,integration}/`): collision unit cases (sphere-box
  face/edge/corner/inside, plane manifold counts, capsule segment cases incl. degenerate/NaN
  safety, GJK/EPA), SO(3) exp/log + inertia, and integration cases (determinism, resting,
  stacking incl. 3-box, capsule, CCD, **restitution**, **friction**, **elastic collision**,
  **broadphase equivalence**, **kinematic motion**). Two bugs found + fixed 2026-07-03
  (kinematic bodies didn't move; CCD suppressed restitution) — see
  [2026-07-03-physics-test-findings.md](../investigations/2026-07-03-physics-test-findings.md).
- **Recent solver additions**: **kinematic bodies** advance by their scripted velocity (ignore
  gravity/impulses, still infinite-mass to the solver); **restitution works under CCD**.
- **Not yet (Phase 3, deferred)**: implicit/differentiable backend + parallel worlds as an
  ML training harness. Physics **Phase 2 + collision polish complete**: SAP + uniform-grid
  broadphase (parallel-sorted), ThreadPool (parallel worlds + colored solver + parallel sort),
  sphere/plane/box/hull/capsule colliders with GJK/EPA + GJK-distance + resting/stacking
  **manifolds**, clamped-Baumgarte solver, and **CCD** (swept AABBs + speculative contacts).
  Possible later: persistent warm-started manifolds, box-box/hull CCD (conservative advancement),
  joints/constraints, sleeping/islands.

## ECS module (`engine::ecs`, 2026-07-03)

Archetype (table) ECS, std-only + `engine::core` (no graphics/physics dependency — they're
consumers). Design: investigations/2026-07-03-ecs-plan.md.

- `Entity` = `core::Handle<EntityTag>` (generational). `World` maps entity index → generation
  + location `{archetype, row}`.
- **Archetype storage**: entities sharing a component set live in one table with contiguous
  per-component columns (SoA); `signature` = sorted component ids. Swap-remove on destroy.
- **Components**: any trivially-copyable struct; compile-time `componentId<T>()` (static
  counter). The first shipped common component is **`engine::Transform`** (in `core`).
- `World::spawn<Ts...>` / `get<T>` / `has<T>` / `destroy`; `query<Ts...>().each(fn)` (per
  entity) / `.chunks(fn)` (per-archetype contiguous spans). Archetype iteration order is
  stable (creation order) → deterministic.
- **Resources**: typed singletons on the World (`setResource<T>`/`getResource<T>`), e.g.
  `Time{dt}`.
- **Scheduler** (`Schedule`): an ordered list of `void(World&)` systems, run in insertion
  order (deterministic). Systems read resources + iterate via queries. Driver
  `tst/ecs/integration/scheduler.cpp` (gravity→integrate, hand-verified deterministic result).
- Not yet: command buffer for deferred structural changes, add/remove-component, parallel
  worlds / within-system parallelism (all planned).
- Driver: `tst/ecs/unit/entities.cpp` (spawn 1500 across 2 archetypes, query/mutate/chunk/destroy, verified).

`core` additions: `core/memory/handle.h` (`Handle<Tag>`, shared by rhi + ecs — the rhi's
`Handle` is now an alias) and `core/math/transform.h` (`engine::Transform`).

## Input + controls (`engine::input`, `engine::input_glfw`, `engine::controls`, 2026-07-03)

Keyboard/mouse (Milestone 2, Phase A), split by dependency so the neutral layer is windowing-
backend-agnostic (GLFW today, Qt/other later) and headless/ML-friendly:
- **`engine::input`** (INTERFACE, header-only; deps core + glm, **GLFW-free**):
  `input::InputState` (`input/input.h`) — `Key`/`MouseButton` enums, level (`keyDown`) + edge
  (`keyPressed`/`keyReleased`) queries, mouse pos + delta, scroll. Mutators (`newFrame`,
  `setKey`, `setMouseButton`, `setMousePosition` (absolute), `addMouseDelta` (relative/event),
  `addScroll`) form an adapter contract that fits **both** polling (GLFW) and event-driven (Qt)
  backends, and scripted/ML input (fill it directly).
- **`engine::input_glfw`** (STATIC; deps input + glfw): `input::GlfwInput` — polls a GLFW window
  (passed as `void*`) into an `InputState`; scroll via a per-window callback registry; cursor
  capture. A future `engine::input_qt` sits alongside it.
- **`engine::controls`** (STATIC; deps ecs + input + core, **graphics-free**): input-driven ECS
  controllers. `controls::FlyController` component + `controls::flyControllerSystem` (a
  `void(World&)` system reading the `input::InputState` + `engine::Time` resources) drive an
  entity's `engine::Transform` (WASD/QE/sprint/RMB-look). The controller only touches
  `Transform` — it doesn't know the entity is a camera.
- **Camera as an ECS entity**: `engine::Camera` (`core/math/camera.h`) is render-agnostic
  *projection* data (perspective/ortho, fovY, near/far, `projectionMatrix(aspect)`; 0..1 depth
  via engine-wide `GLM_FORCE_DEPTH_ZERO_TO_ONE`). A camera entity = `Transform` (pose) +
  `Camera` (projection) + optional `FlyController`. `scene::extractViews` turns each
  `<Transform, Camera>` into a `render::RenderView` (view = inverse(pose)); the app fills each
  view's materials + target (invalid target ⇒ primary swapchain).
- `engine::Time` (`core/time.h`): frame-dt resource for variable-rate systems (physics keeps
  its own `FixedStep`).
- Drivers: `tst/input/unit/input_state.cpp` (edges/deltas/scroll), `tst/controls/unit/
  fly_controller.cpp` (ECS controller, headless), `tst/core/unit/camera.cpp` (projection);
  `tst/graphics/visual/input_demo.cpp` (windowed: camera-entity + Schedule[input-pump → fly] +
  extractViews + background/light toggles).

## Scene module (`engine::scene`, 2026-07-03)

The ECS↔render bridge — the only module that depends on **both** `engine::ecs` and
`engine::graphics` (keeps `ecs` graphics-free and the `Renderer` ECS-free).
- **Render components**: `RenderMesh { render::MeshHandle }`, `RenderMaterial { uint32_t
  materialIndex }` (trivially copyable → usable as ECS components).
- **Extraction system**: `scene::extract(World, pipeline, ExtractedScene&)` queries
  `<Transform, RenderMesh, RenderMaterial>`, buckets instances by mesh (one instanced draw per
  mesh), and fills `RenderItem[] + InstanceData[]` for a `render::RenderView`.
- Driver: `tst/graphics/integration/scene.cpp` (ECS entities → extract → render → pixel-verified);
  `tst/graphics/visual/grid.cpp` is ECS-driven (a bob system + extraction each frame).
- **Environment** (`scene/environment.h`, Phase A): `Background` + `SceneLighting` ECS resources
  + `applyEnvironment(world, view)` copies them onto a `RenderView` (clearColor + directional
  light). The Renderer packs `RenderView::light` into a `GlobalUniforms` (viewProj + light) at
  binding 0; `mesh.slang` does ambient + Lambert shading (configurable, was hardcoded).
- **`scene::extractViews`** (Phase A): builds one `RenderView` per `<Transform, engine::Camera>`
  entity (view = inverse(pose), proj from Camera, environment applied); items/instances shared
  from `extract`. Camera-as-entity → maps onto RenderView's multi-view design.

## What is NOT here yet

Genuinely open gaps (see todo.md for the full backlog):

- **ECS**: command buffer for deferred structural changes, add/remove-component, and parallel
  worlds / within-system parallelism. (Archetype core, queries, resources, and the ordered
  `Schedule` all exist.)
- **Vulkan behind the RHI**: only the Metal backend is live. The legacy Vulkan code is parked
  under `src/graphics/vulkan/` and not yet ported behind the RHI (graphics refactor item 3).
- **Headless/offscreen split**: the Metal `Device` has a headless path and offscreen tests, but
  `Swapchain` and `Renderer` aren't cleanly separated yet, and there's no window-free *windowed*
  path abstraction for ML/offline (graphics refactor item 7).
- **Bindless textures**: `baseColorTexture` + `Device::registerBindlessTexture` are stubs
  (per-instance material *colors* work; textured surfaces are the next step).
- **Compute**: no compute pipelines or compute-queue usage (needed for ML + some rendering).
- **`core::io`/`image`**: `readFile`/`loadObj`/`loadImage` + `Image` not yet in `engine::core`
  (loaders still live in the parked graphics code).
- **Physics Phase 3**: implicit/differentiable backend + parallel-world ML harness.
- **Application entry point**: intentionally none — this is a library; driver tests under
  `tst/` stand in for the consuming app.

Already done (previously listed here as missing): `engine::core` is populated (geometry,
memory/Handle, math/Transform, threading); the Metal backend has pipelines, command recording,
swapchain/present, and Slang shaders (`.metallib`/`.spv`); the ECS scheduler + resources +
`scene::extract` render-extraction all exist; and there's a real test harness
(`tst/harness/`, `tests`/`benchmarks`/`visuals` runners) with unit + integration coverage.
